Playing around the wavefunction:

1. Select different States (e.g., “Ψ1 |0⟩”).


2. Press “Collapse Wave Function”.


3. Look at which state it collapses to this time—because of the random probabilities, it might collapse into Ψ1, Ψ2, or Ψ3, no matter which one was initially selected.


4. Watch the circles redraw to reflect the new outcome.



The white circles in the black box (canvas) are the "visual effect" showing that a collapse happened. 
If it collapses to "Superposition," we see slightly larger circles. 
Otherwise, they're a bit smaller. • 
Every time we click "Collapse Wave Function," it clears the canvas and draws new random circles.
